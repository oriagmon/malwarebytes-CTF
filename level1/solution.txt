We extraced the python file "another" from the exe,
we have found there the creds:
- "hackerman" hardcoded as "login" 
- Password123 as a hash we could easily break with online hash rainbow table
- the pin code:
	we had to extract the python functions, brute force till we find a pin code which is, when used as seed to random() 32 times, returns the following hash: fb4b322c518e9f6a52af906e32aee955.
	9667 was the correct pin.
	see full code in level1-pin-decoder.py


Level one ends with the following string:
"Good job, the first level passed! Prepare for more fun!
Make sure that the internet is connected.
Are you ready?"

I am ready :)

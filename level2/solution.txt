Level two begins with the following string:
"Level #2: Find the secret console..."

as mentioned when finished level1, the program requires internet connection.
that's because the program connects to remote server to download an image
We were able to extract the URL(with: decode_and_fetch_url()), which is used to download a png, and download it for examination.

That png is actually a DLL encrypted with AES key.
The AES (symetric) key can be recoverd from level- it is thehash generated in level1.
-> you can see this code in level2.py

The result is-a-probibly DLL (because it's magic heaader), which is now loaded into the memory of the program, and executed (with: prepare_stage())

We can assume that DLL is generting the so-called: "secret console",
the exact thing we would needed to exmaine!
